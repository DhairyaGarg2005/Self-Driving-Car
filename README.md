# Self Driving Car
In this project, Udacity's Self Driving Simulation Environment was used to predict the steering angles for the car. The vehicle was trained using the CNN (Convolution Neural Network) from the actual feed data obtained using the training mode. The model was trained using this data using machine learning techniques to predict the path, which was used to drive the car in autonomous mode.
# Contents in this Repository
This repository contains about 1500 images (of 22,275) captured to train the model, along with the Excel sheet of the data for all the images. 

In addition, two Python codes that define and implement the model are presented as model.h5.

Three videos are attached, showing the outputs for the different environments trained and the input for the Anaconda command prompt.
